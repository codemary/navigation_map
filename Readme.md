## Neighborhood Map

This is a simple application which fetches nearby restaurants and shows them on a map. Restaurants can be further
filtered by a search query.

## Setup

```
$ git clone https://github.com/codemary/navigation_map.git
$ cd navigation_map
$ npm install -g gulp
$ npm install
$ gulp
$ open index.html
```

Foursquare API is being used to fetch nearby restaurants. Google Maps is being used for showing the restaurants on 
a map.
